OMG, "The Last Leaf" was like, SO emotional! It made me cry, like, literally cry. So, these two artist chicks, Sue and Johnsy, live together, right? And Johnsy gets this awful pneumonia and just gives up, all depressed about the leaves falling outside their window. She thinks it's a sign she's gonna die too, which is, like, super morbid, duh! Sue is freaking out, trying to keep Johnsy's spirits up, but it's no use. Johnsy just keeps counting the falling leaves, thinking each one is a countdown to her own doom. Seriously, so dramatic! Then comes Mr. Behrman, this old dude who lives downstairs and is, like, a total failure as an artist. But guess what? He's a total hero! He sees how bummed Johnsy is and actually goes out in this crazy storm to paint a SINGLE leaf on the ivy vine outside their window! Can you believe it? That's dedication, right? So, when Johnsy wakes up and sees this one, perfect green leaf still clinging on even after the storm, she's like, whoa! Maybe giving up isn't the answer after all. She realizes life is precious and all that jazz, and guess what? She starts getting better! Talk about a miracle, right? But here's the sad part (cue the tears again!). Mr. Behrman gets sick from being out in the storm. Turns out, he caught pneumonia too, and even worse, he dies! So Johnsy gets better because of Mr. Behrman's sacrifice, which is, like, super sad but also kind of beautiful in a weird way, you know? It shows that even when things seem hopeless, there's always someone who cares and is willing to do anything, even risk their own life, to help you out. Mr. Behrman might not have been a successful artist, but he sure was a hero in my book! This story totally taught me that friendship is, like, the most important thing ever. Sue never gave up on Johnsy, and Mr. Behrman, even though he wasn't even that close to them, went above and beyond to help. Plus, it kind of shows that sometimes you gotta fight for what you want, even when things look bleak. Johnsy could have just given up, but she didn't, and that's pretty inspiring, I gotta admit. So yeah, "The Last Leaf" was a rollercoaster of emotions, but overall, it was a pretty awesome story!
